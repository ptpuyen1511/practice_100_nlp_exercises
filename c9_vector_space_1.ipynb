Anarchism holds the state to be undesirable, unnecessary, or harmful. While anti-statism is central, anarchism entails opposing authority or hierarchical organisation in the conduct of human relations, including, but not limited to, the state system.\n","As a subtle and anti-dogmatic philosophy, anarchism draws on many currents of thought and strategy. Anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view, instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy. There are many types and traditions of anarchism, not all of which are mutually exclusive. Anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism. Strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism or similar dual classifications. Anarchism is usually considered a radical left-wing ideology, and much of anarchist economics and anarchist legal philosophy reflect anti-authoritarian interpretations of communism, collectivism, syndicalism, mutualism, or participatory economics.\n","The central tendency of anarchism as a social movement has been represented by anarcho-communism and anarcho-syndicalism, with individualist anarchism being primarily a literary phenomenon which nevertheless did have an impact on the bigger currents and individualists have also participated in large anarchist organisations. Many anarchists oppose all forms of aggression, supporting self-defense or non-violence (anarcho-pacifism), while others have supported the use of some coercive measures, including violent revolution and propaganda of the deed as means to achieve anarchist ends.\n","Etymology and terminology.\n","The term \"anarchism\" is a compound word composed from the word \"anarchy\" and the suffix \"-ism\", themselves derived respectively from the Greek , i.e. \"anarchy\" (from , \"anarchos\", meaning \"one without rulers\"; from the privative prefix ἀν- (\"an-\", i.e. \"without\") and , \"archos\", i.e. \"leader\", \"ruler\"; (cf. \"archon\" or , \"arkhē\", i.e. \"authority\", \"sovereignty\", \"realm\", \"magistracy\")) and the suffix or (\"-ismos\", \"-isma\", from the verbal infinitive suffix -ίζειν, \"-izein\"). The first known use of this word was in 1539.\"Anarchist\" was the term adopted by Maximilien de Robespierre to attack those on the left whom he had used for his own ends during the French Revolution but was determined to get rid of, though among these \"anarchists\" there were few who exhibited the social revolt characteristics of later anarchists. There would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation, such as William Godwin and Wilhelm Weitling, but they did not use the word \"anarchist\" or \"anarchism\" in describing themselves or their beliefs. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon was the first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist, marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-nineteenth century. Since the 1890s from France, the term \"libertarianism\" has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and was used almost exclusively in this sense until the 1950s in the United States; its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States. On the other hand, some use \"libertarianism\" to refer to individualistic free-market philosophy only, referring to free-market anarchism as \"libertarian anarchism\".\n","History.\n","Origins.\n","The earliest anarchist themes can be found in the 6th century BC, among the works of Taoist philosopher Laozi, and in later centuries by Zhuangzi and Bao Jingyan. Zhuangzi's philosophy has been described by various sources as anarchist. Zhuangzi wrote, \"A petty thief is put in jail. A great brigand becomes a ruler of a Nation.\" Diogenes of Sinope and the Cynics, their contemporary Zeno of Citium, the founder of Stoicism, also introduced similar topics. Jesus is sometimes considered the first anarchist in the Christian anarchist tradition. Georges Lechartier wrote that \"The true founder of anarchy was Jesus Christ and ... the first anarchist society was that of the apostles.\" In early Islamic history, some manifestations of anarchic thought are found during the Islamic civil war over the Caliphate, where the Kharijites insisted that the imamate is a right for each individual within the Islamic society. Later, some Muslim scholars, such as Amer al-Basri and Abu Hanifa, led movements of boycotting the rulers, paving the way to the waqf (endowments) tradition, which served as an alternative to and asylum from the centralized authorities of the emirs. But such interpretations reverberates subversive religious conceptions like the aforementioned seemingly anarchistic Taoist teachings and that of other anti-authoritarian religious traditions creating a complex relationship regarding the question as to whether or not anarchism and religion are compatible. This is exemplified when the glorification of the state is viewed as a form of sinful idolatry.\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"tVqjpQmoDZiQ","colab_type":"code","outputId":"092e0c11-bf77-4cf6-dd4d-6d03a96b8e5d","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1587226333115,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":5039,"user":{"displayName":"Uyên

Context của mỗi từ t được định nghĩa như sau:\n","\n","* Trích xuất các từ ở trước và sau của t với kích thước cửa sổ là d (chú ý context words của t sẽ không bao gồm bản thân của từ t)\n","* Với mỗi từ t, kích thước của context (window size) d sẽ được chọn ngẫu nhiên trong tập {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"yWcZOCb8Z647","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["# Read file\n","with open('enwiki_tokenized_compound_words.txt', 'r') as f:\n","    lines = f.readlines()\n","\n","from random import randint # for random window size\n","\n","\n","with open('word_context.txt', 'w') as f:\n","    for line in lines:\n","        list_word = line.strip().split()\n","\n","        n_word = len(list_word)\n","\n","        for idx,word in enumerate(list_word):\n","            window_size = randint(1, 5)\n","\n","            list_context = list_word[max(0, idx - window_size):idx] + list_word[\n","                                                                                min(idx+1, n_word): min(idx+1+window_size, n_word)]\n","\n","            for context in list_context:\n","                f.write(word + '\\t' + context + '\\n')"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"xPw17KZPb40J","colab_type":"code","outputId":"0ac0e5be-850e-4270-9f50-84b2dc694507","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1589019156186,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":4229,"user":{"displayName":"Uyên Phan Thị Phương","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GiijKAhyj7aP8xr8kcdLaOI4T7SSx6ouaFX6-w4gQ=s64","userId":"07106054718633244101"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":187}},"source":["!head word_context.txt"],"execution_count":9,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Anarchism\tis\n","Anarchism\ta\n","is\tAnarchism\n","is\ta\n","is\tpolitical\n","is\tphilosophy\n","is\tthat\n","is\tadvocates\n","a\tAnarchism\n","a\tis\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"O7iF0O_aeSZv","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# 83.
